This is a Manual APWorld for "Legendary: A Marvel Deckbuilding Game"

Rules: 

- You start with 5 random heroes unlocked, and can only use those 5 heroes until finding/getting sent other heroes

- You start with a random Base Set (Core Set, Villains, Marvel Studios Phase 1, Marvel Studios What if...?) unlocked, and can only use non-hero content from that set. Items found/sent to you will unlock other sets to play.

- Collect all 6 Infinity Stones to win

- Extra Rules: If a scheme or mastermind asks you to use a hero or combination of heroes you do not have unlocked yet, use what you have to the best of your ability and add in your not unlocked heroes if needed.

Requirements:

- At least 1 Base Set (Core Set, Villains, Marvel Studios Phase 1, Marvel Studios What if...?).

- For the best experience, at least a few other sets. This is playable without extras but you will have access to all of your available content at the start of the game and it will be in my opinion not very interesting.

Installation and Usage Instructions:

Step 1: Download and Install the lastest Archipelago from here: https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago\

Step 2: Download the lastest stable manual apworld file from here: https://github.com/ManualForArchipelago/Manual

Step 3: Download the lastest apworld file and yaml files from this github page.

Step 4: Place the apworld files from steps 2 and 3 into the custom_worlds folder in your archipelago install.

Optional Step 4.5: Download the latest Tracker apworld file from here and place it into your custom_worlds folder: https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases

Step 5: Edit the downloaded yaml file with your desired options and place it into the Players folder. Instructions on editing yaml files can be found here: https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en

If playing a multiworld with other games/players put the yaml files for those games in here as well. 

Step 6: Run the ArchipelagoGenerate.exe file from your archipelago installation. If the command line says there is a problem with your yaml file make sure that it is formatted correctly. When it's finished a zip file should be placed in the output folder of your archipelago installation. 

Step 7: Go to https://archipelago.gg/uploads and upload the zip file from the previous step. Click the "Create Room" button and keep track of the room URL. If you lose/forget the room you can find it again in the "Getting Started -> User Content" page of the archipelago website. Also note down the server info (archipelago.gg:#####) above the player list, your player name, and your manual game name (Manual_MarvelLegendary_Samitian)

Step 8: Run the ArchipelagoLauncher.exe file from your archipelago installation and click the "Manual Client" button on the right side. Plug in the server info and the manual name into the fields in the top and click the connect button. If done correctly it should say to enter a slot name, type in your player name and press enter.

Step 9: If everything is done correctly, it will say something like "Player1 (Team #1) playing Manual_MarvelLegendary_Samitian has joined. Client(0.5.1), ['AP'].". If so, you are good to go. Go to the manual tab of the manual client, on the left side is everything you have unlocked, on the right side are all the "checks" you can do in the game. Click a check when you've done it to send whatever item is on it out to the server. If you have the tracker apworld installed from step 4.5 every check you are currently allowed to do will be highlighted in green.
