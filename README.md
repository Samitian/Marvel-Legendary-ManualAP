This is a Manual APWorld for "Legendary: A Marvel Deckbuilding Game"

Rules: You start with the Core Set unlocked, and can only use content from that set. Items found/sent to you will unlock other sets to play.
Collect all 6 Infinity Stones to win

Requirements:
The Legendary: Marvel Core Set
At least a few other sets, if solo generating. Playing without extras is possible if playing with other AP slots but you will have access to all of your content at the start of the game and will be in general not very interesting in my opinion.
