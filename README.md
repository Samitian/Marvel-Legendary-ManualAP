This is a Manual APWorld for "Legendary: A Marvel Deckbuilding Game"

Rules: 

- You start with 5 random heroes unlocked, and can only use those 5 heroes until finding/getting sent other heroes

- You start with a random Base Set (Core Set, Villains, Marvel Studios Phase 1, Marvel Studios What if...?) unlocked, and can only use non-hero content from that set. Items found/sent to you will unlock other sets to play.

- Collect all 6 Infinity Stones to win

Requirements:

- At least 1 Base Set (Core Set, Villains, Marvel Studios Phase 1, Marvel Studios What if...?).

- For the best experience, at least a few other sets. This is playable without extras but you will have access to all of your available content at the start of the game and it will be in my opinion not very interesting.
